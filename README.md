# Evolutionary dynamics of N-person Hawk-Dove games - INFO-F409 Project

This project has been made in context of the INFO-F409 course at the ULB. It aims at reproducing the results generated by Chen et al. (2017) (1).

The game analysed is the HDG. A variation with a threshold is also implemented (HDG-T).

The dynamics has been analysed in both finite and infinite populations.

In order to plot a graph, simply run `finite_populations.py` or `infinite_populations.py` and by replacing in the main statement what you actually want. Most possible plots are given as comments in this statement. 



This project has been lead by Edgar Badalyan, Alexandre Missenard, Raffaele Todesco, Franck Trouillez and Ludéric Van Calck.
